# Stacked-Dielectric-Tubular-Actuator

## Scope
Develop an methodlogy to determine the onset of stacked tubes's instability. This project involves solving loads of system of algebraic equations and differential equations using python and mathematica. 

## Method
* A systematic study on prismatic bifurcation of stacked dielectric cylinders is performed under coupled mechanical and electrical loading conditions. The system consists of two stacked cylindrical layers, each modeled as a homogeneous, isotropic dielectric solid.

The cylinders are subjected to:
* Uniform internal pressure applied on the inner surface of the inner cylinder
* Electric loading across the thickness of the cylinder

Two axial constraints are considered:
* Axially free cylinders
* Axially stretched cylinders
